Debian 8 (*jessie*) has the rTorrent's version 0.9.2 (a release [between 2012 and
2014](https://github.com/rakshasa/rtorrent/releases)). 

This post explains two ways for installing rTorrent 0.9.6.

## From official repository

This method is simplets and quickly but you could break your packages dependencies.

First, add *testing* repository

```
echo "deb http://ftp.debian.org/debian stretch main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/stretch.list
apt-get update
```

Then, install rtorrent

```
apt-get install --no-install-recommends -y rtorrent
```

For *keeping* the branch stable, remove the stretch's packages from list

```
sed -i 's/^/#/' /etc/apt/sources.list.d/stretch.list
apt-get update
```

## From source code (plus: color UI)

This method requires a few minutes but you don't install packages from another branch.

I created an script for doing this task based on [rTorrent Auto Install](https://github.com/Kerwood/Rtorrent-Auto-Install).

```
#!/bin/sh

# Path to sources
SRCD="/usr/local/src"

# Make command (aborting if `make` fails)
MCMD="make && make install || exit 1"

# Install build dependencies
apt-get install --no-install-recommends -y \
  automake build-essential libsigc++-2.0-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev libtool libcppunit-dev \
  libncurses5-de openssl libssl-dev

cd ${SRCD}

# xmlrpc-c super-stable
wget -qO - https://sourceforge.net/projects/xmlrpc-c/files/Xmlrpc-c%20Super%20Stable/1.33.18/xmlrpc-c-1.33.18.tgz/download | tar zxvf -
cd xmlrpc-c-1.33.18
./configure prefix=/usr/local --disable-cplusplus
${MCMD}

cd ${SRCD}

# libtorrent
wget -qO - http://rtorrent.net/downloads/libtorrent-0.13.6.tar.gz | tar zxvf -
cd libtorrent-0.13.6
./autogen.sh
./configure --prefix=/usr/local
${MCMD}

cd ${SRCD}

# rtorrent with canvas patch
wget -qO - http://rtorrent.net/downloads/rtorrent-0.9.6.tar.gz | tar zxvf -
cd rtorrent-0.9.6
wget -O rtorrent-0.9.6_color.patch http://pastie.org/pastes/10823264/download
patch -uNp1 -i rtorrent-0.9.6_color.patch
sed '/AM_PATH_CPPUNIT/d' -i configure.ac
./autogen.sh
./configure --prefix=/usr/local --with-xmlrpc-c
${MCMD}
ldconfig
```
