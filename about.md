### The author

(Soon.)

### This site

For writing posts in this blog I used the best editor ever:
[jed](http://www.jedsoft.org/jed).

DNS service is provided by [FreeDNS](http://freedns.afraid.org).

The blog is hosted on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com) and
powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and 
[Pixyll](https://github.com/johnotander/pixyll) (with some changes by
me).
